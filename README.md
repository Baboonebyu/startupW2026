# Temple Match Utah

[My Notes](notes.md)

Temple Match is a web app designed to help you practice matching the different temples in Utah with their correct names. It provides a fun way to learn and allows you to compete against your friends. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

Do you want to impress your friends? Or maybe you are like me and have accidentally gone to the wrong temple before. With over 30 temples in utah in a variety of different stages, there is a lot to remember. Temple Match Utah is here to help you learn and have fun while doing it. Improve your knowledge and compete for the high score.
